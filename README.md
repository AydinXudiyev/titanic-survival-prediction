# Titanic Survival Prediction Application

This application predicts whether a passenger could have survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning techniques, specifically leveraging the **Logistic Regression** algorithm from the `scikit-learn` library. The app features a user-friendly interface built with **Streamlit**, allowing users to input passenger data and receive survival predictions.

## Overview

The Titanic Survival Prediction App utilizes passenger characteristics such as age, gender, family size, class, and fare to generate predictions about survival. It employs data preprocessing techniques and robust scaling to ensure accurate predictions.

## Features

- Interactive user input for passenger characteristics through a sidebar.
- Logistic Regression model for survival prediction.
- Display of prediction results along with probabilities.
- Visual representation of the input data for better understanding.
